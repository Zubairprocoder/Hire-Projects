# Hire-Projects
I build modern web apps using **React**, **Next.js**, **Firebase**, and **Tailwind CSS**, focused on fast, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. My projects — Password Manager, GetMeAChai, URL Shortener, LinkTree Clone, and Todo App — showcase real-world skills in authentication, database, and scalable UI design.
